# Improving Horiseon Webpage Accessibility

## Description

## **This repository updates existing code on the "Horiseon" webpage to increase readability and accessibility.**

### Replacing 'div' Elements
Existing 'div' elements have been switched with semantic HTML elements for better readability.
### CSS Optimization
Existing CSS classes have been consolidated (or eliminated) to reduce redundancy, and have been appropriately switched to ID tags if their respective properties are only applied to just one HTML element. Furthermore, CSS selectors and their properties have been rearranged to better reflect the semantic flow in the HTML file.
### Image Accessibility
All image elements now have an "alt" attribute or an "aria-label" to further promote accessibility.
